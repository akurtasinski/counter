Inspired by Nalsoft [AIM Log Manager](http://www.nalsoft.com/?page=welcome), which I used heavily in the early 2000s, I wanted to create an analogous tool that would provide much of the same functionality for me now.

**counter** is a toy for myself, first and foremost, but secondarily it is a utility to visualize and analyze chatlogs generated by libpurple clients.

**lumos** is the current active branch of the project. Before this iteration, using wxPython, I experimented with **alohomora** (PyObjC - not recommended, unfortunately, but an interesting experiment) and **incendio** (Flex, which was interesting but didn't have the snappiness or native feel I was looking for).
