Inspired by Nalsoft AIM Log Manager (http://www.nalsoft.com/?page=welcome), which I used heavily in the early 2000s, I wanted to create an analogous utility that would provide much of the same functionality for me now.

=counter= is a toy for myself, first and foremost, but secondarily it is a utility to visualize and analyze chatlogs generated by libpurple clients.

There have been several significant iterations since its conception. =alohomora= was an ill-fated PyObjC version (not recommended, unfortunately, but an interesting experiment), =incendio= is a proof-of-concept incarnation in the Flex framework, and finally =lumos= is the latest re-attempting of a pure python (GUI courtesy of wxPython) solution.
